# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository contains work for the Data Science: Data Cleaning course.

# The Project
This project demonstrates the preparation of a tidy data set by collecting and cleaning raw data. A R script run_analysis.R does the following:
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# The Dataset
The UCI HAR Dataset can be downloaded and extracted here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The extracted dataset in a directory titled "UCI HAR Dataset" contains all files and directories used in run_analysis.R.
Files include subjects, activity labels, features, test and train data, and additional information detailing the raw data.

# The Codebook
You Codebook.md contains additional information on the variables and transformations performed.
